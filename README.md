# Description
MicViz is a microphone visualizer using rectangles to represent the amplitude of every frequences heard by the mic

# Installation
For now, you have to launch a live server on vscode or anyhow because there are multiple js files on a folder and browsers won't run it locally, exept if it is hosted on a server.  
I might move it to https://nerter.fr later.
